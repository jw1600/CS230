The Gaming Room wanted us to design a web-based multi-platform version of their existing Android-only game Draw It or Lose It. The game is based on the 1980s TV game Win, Lose or Draw. Our goal was to help the client list software design problems, design constraints, and propose solutions. And we will explain how to apply customer requirements to existing architectures for different operating platforms.
During the development process, I consulted a lot of information, introduced the advantages and disadvantages of each platform to the client, and found the best solution.
Before the development process, it is important to fully understand the client's needs, because this determines the direction of research. For example, the client's focus is on cross-platform online games. Therefore, understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each platform is the most important task. If the direction is wrong, it will lead to a lot of development work, and finally find that the selected platform is not suitable for cross-platform operation, or choose the wrong platform, which will eventually lead to too high costs for the client. Therefore, it is very important to understand the client's needs and make a reasonable plan.
